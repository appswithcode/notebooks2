### Energy Efficiency

You have limited attention span (which could be adjusted) & energy. Your computational resources should be valued.

### Default Mode

- safety first
- primal instincts
- ego

Your brain's  `default mode` does not go hand in hand with your life goals.

### Stoicism

```
Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BCE. 
It is a philosophy of personal eudaemonic virtue ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world, 
asserting that the practice of virtue is both necessary and sufficient to achieve 
eudaimoniaâ€”flourishing by means of living an ethical life. The Stoics identified the path to eudaimonia with a life 
spent practicing the cardinal virtues and living in accordance with nature.
```

- Focus on what you can control
- You control how you react to things

Stoicism is a somewhat energy-efficient philosophy of living.

Probably focusing is the easy part, but the hard part is making sure that you can focus when you want to.
Namely, you have to nurture a support system which refuels your tank when it runs low.

Mindfulness, meditational and martial art practices are quite effective.

Meditation basically means "not thinking".
It probably lets prefrontal cortex take a break.

I started listening to podcasts after the pandemic started. 

```
Garbage in garbage out
```
This I read this phrase from [Steal Like an Artist (affiliated)](https://amzn.to/3cyoLlW) which is the first English book I read, it stuck in my head till this day.

### [Huberman Podcast](https://hubermanlab.com/)
This is probably the best podcast on health and wellness.
Professor Andrew Huberman covers a lot of relevant and useful topics. Our body is the only machine that does not come with a user manual.
The content Hubermanlab provides can be used as that user manual.
